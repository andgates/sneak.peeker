Question:
 5. Define a function in Scheme whose first argument is a predicate (a
    function of one argument which returns either #t or #f) and whose
    second argument is a list.  If the predicate returns #t for any
    element of the list, contains returns #t, otherwise it returns #f.
    [2pt]

    > (contains (lambda (x) (= x 3)) '(1 2 3 4))
    #t
    > (contains (lambda (x) (> x 9)) '(1 2 3 4))
    #f

Question:
 7. With respect to Java, the term ``overloading'' refers to:

    (C) Multiple functions with the same name and different
        signatures, defined in the same class.
