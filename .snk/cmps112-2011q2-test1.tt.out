Question:
 7. Define a Scheme function map2 whose arguments are a binary
    function and two lists.  It returns a list whose length is the
    same as the shorter list consisting of elements by using the
    function to combine corresponding elements of the list.  [3pt]

    > (map2 * '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
    (4 10 18)

Question:
 5. Define a function in Scheme whose first argument is a predicate (a
    function of one argument which returns either #t or #f) and whose
    second argument is a list.  If the predicate returns #t for any
    element of the list, contains returns #t, otherwise it returns #f.

Question:
 8. Define a function foldl which takes a function, a unit value, and
    a list, and returns a single value by applying the function
    between each member of the list.  It must be tail recursive.
