Question:
 9. Define the same function in Perl.  It takes a reference to a
    function of two arguments, followed by references to two arrays
    and applies the function pairwise to the arrays, returning an
    array of the shorter length.  [2pt]
    Example:  @y = zip sub{$_[0]+$_[1]}, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7];
    print "@y\n";
    Prints:  5 7 9

Question:
 8. Define the function zip in Scheme.  It takes a function and a pair
    of lists and returns a list having pairwise applied the function
    to corresponding pairs of elements in the list.  If the lists are
    of unequal length, the function stops when the shorter list runs
    out.  [2pt]
    Example:  (zip + '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6 7))
    Returns:  (5 7 9)

Question:
 1. Define a function grep in Scheme whose first argument is a

Question:
 7. Write a complete program in Perl that reads in words from all of
    the filenames specified in @ARGV, and after end of file of the
    last file, prints out each word, one per line, sorted
    lexicographically, with each word followed by a count of the
    number of times it occurred.  Exit status is 0 for success and 1
    if any file could not be opened.  Print suitable error messaages
    for files that could not be opened.  If no files are specified,
    read the standard input.  Do not use the <> operator.  Use /\w+/
    to match words or /\W+/ to split delimiters.  If @ARGV is empty,
    use "-" (standard input).  [5pt]
